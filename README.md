# Audit HELM Reproduction

This folder contains a reusable, shell-first workflow for reproducing selected
historic HELM runs with the local `kwdagger` pipeline, then comparing the
reproduced outputs against the public HELM bundle.

The design goals are:

- work out of the box in the current environment,
- remain portable to a fresh operator via environment variables,
- keep heavyweight run artifacts outside the repo by default,
- start with a small smoke-test batch,
- scale later to larger reproduction attempts without redesign.

Remote reproduction-only machines do not need `/data/crfm-helm-public` mounted.
The public HELM bundle is only required on the analysis machine that will do
historic comparisons later. If a manifest sets `precomputed_root: null`, the
runner now skips the `HELM_PRECOMPUTED_ROOT` existence check.

## Defaults

These defaults are chosen to work in the current environment:

- `AIQ_MAGNET_ROOT=$HOME/code/aiq-magnet`
- `AIQ_PYTHON=python`
- `HELM_PRECOMPUTED_ROOT=/data/crfm-helm-public`
- `AUDIT_RESULTS_ROOT=/data/crfm-helm-audit`

Assumptions:

- `magnet` is importable from `AIQ_PYTHON`
- `kwdagger` is on `PATH`
- `helm-run` is on `PATH`

Optional environment variables:

- `AUDIT_DEFAULT_MAX_EVAL_INSTANCES`
- `AUDIT_DEFAULT_TMUX_WORKERS`

## Folder Layout

- `configs/`
  Checked-in manifests and templates.
- `scripts/`
  Shell entrypoints for operators.
- `python/`
  Python helpers used by the shell scripts.
- `reports/`
  Lightweight comparison reports.
- `examples/`
  Example command sequences.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd $HOME/code/helm-reproducibility
```

1. Validate the environment:

```bash
scripts/check_env.sh
```

2. Materialize a smoke-test manifest:

```bash
scripts/make_smoke_manifest.sh
```

To materialize the first apples-to-apples control manifest instead:

```bash
scripts/make_apples_manifest.sh
```

By default this writes:

```text
configs/generated/smoke_manifest.generated.yaml
```

And the apples-to-apples variant writes:

```text
configs/generated/apples_manifest.generated.yaml
```

3. Launch the smoke-test batch on the GPU machine:

```bash
scripts/run_smoke.sh
```

To change which GPUs `kwdagger` schedules onto, set the manifest `devices`
field or regenerate the manifest with `--devices`, for example:

```bash
scripts/make_smoke_manifest.sh \
  configs/generated/smoke_manifest.generated.yaml \
  --devices 2,3
```

4. Compare the completed batch to the historic HELM bundle:

```bash
scripts/compare_batch.sh
```

Reports are written by default to:

```text
reports/<experiment_name>/
```

Heavy run outputs are written by default to:

```text
/data/crfm-helm-audit/<experiment_name>/
```

## Refreshing Analysis From Latest Data

When new raw audit runs have landed under `/data/crfm-helm-audit`, the easiest
way to refresh analysis is:

1. rebuild the audit index
2. regenerate the specific report you care about from that index

Rebuild the index:

```bash
AUDIT_FALLBACK_HOST=aiq-gpu \
scripts/index_results.sh
```

This writes:

- `reports/indexes/audit_results_index_<timestamp>.jsonl`
- `reports/indexes/audit_results_index_<timestamp>.csv`
- `reports/indexes/audit_results_index_<timestamp>.txt`

Use `AUDIT_FALLBACK_HOST` for older runs that predate explicit process
provenance capture. Newer runs will record machine context directly in each job
directory via `process_context.json`.

Then rebuild a core metric report for a specific run entry:

```bash
scripts/rebuild_core_report_from_index.sh \
  --run-entry 'narrative_qa:model=lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3,data_augmentation=canonical'
```

This will:

- pick the newest two indexed kwdagger runs for that exact `run_entry`
- find the best matching historic HELM run from `/data/crfm-helm-public`
- regenerate the core metric report bundle automatically

Each stable report directory now stores timestamped artifacts under:

- `.history/<YYYYMMDD>/`

The top-level user-facing files are symlinks to the newest timestamped
artifacts, for example:

- `core_metric_management_summary.latest.txt`
- `core_metric_report.latest.txt`
- `core_metric_report.latest.json`
- `core_metric_report.latest.png`
- `core_metric_overlay_distributions.latest.png`
- `core_metric_ecdfs.latest.png`
- `core_runlevel_table.latest.csv`
- `report_selection.latest.json`
- `instance_samples_kwdagger_repeat.latest.txt`
- `instance_samples_official_vs_kwdagger.latest.txt`
- `kwdagger_a.run`
- `kwdagger_b.run`
- `official.run`
- `kwdagger_a.job`
- `kwdagger_b.job`

This is the preferred way to inspect the newest version of a report without
guessing which timestamp is current.

The raw-run symlinks make it easy to jump directly from a report bundle back to
the exact local and historic run directories that were selected for analysis.
The instance sample reports are text summaries produced from
`HelmRunDiff.summarize_instances(...)` and are intended as the first stop when
you want to inspect prompts, completions, references, and the largest per-run
instance mismatches in a suspicious case.

If only one local run exists and you still want a report, allow reuse of that
single run on both sides of the repeatability slot:

```bash
scripts/rebuild_core_report_from_index.sh \
  --run-entry 'narrative_qa:model=lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3,data_augmentation=canonical' \
  --allow-single-repeat
```

This is the preferred workflow for fast iteration when we want to keep changing
what we measure or how we visualize it without manually reconstructing run
paths.

To rebuild all currently available core reports from the latest index:

```bash
bash scripts/rebuild_all_core_reports_from_index.sh
```

If you want the tool to emit reports even for entries with only one matching
kwdagger run, use:

```bash
bash scripts/rebuild_all_core_reports_from_index.sh \
  --allow-single-repeat
```

After rebuilding the per-run-spec reports, generate an overall reproducibility
assessment across all currently available core reports:

```bash
bash scripts/aggregate_core_reports.sh
```

This writes:

- `reports/overall-reproducibility/.history/<YYYYMMDD>/overall_reproducibility_summary_<timestamp>.*`
- stable symlinks:
  - `overall_reproducibility_summary.latest.txt`
  - `overall_reproducibility_summary.latest.json`
  - `overall_reproducibility_summary.latest.csv`
  - `overall_reproducibility_summary.latest.md`

The runner also derives a distinct `kwdagger` queue name from the experiment
name, which helps avoid interactive tmux collision prompts when multiple audit
batches have been launched on the same machine.

If you want to inspect a specific pair directly without rebuilding the full
core report, you can write an instance-sample inspection report with:

```bash
bash scripts/inspect_pair_samples.sh \
  --run-a /path/to/run_a \
  --run-b /path/to/run_b \
  --label investigation_pair \
  --report-dpath reports/manual-inspection
```

For a newly synced kwdagger experiment, you can rebuild only the reports
relevant to that experiment and write a focused summary with:

```bash
AUDIT_FALLBACK_HOST=aiq-gpu \
bash scripts/index_results.sh

bash scripts/analyze_experiment_from_index.sh \
  --experiment-name audit-vicuna-nochat-overnight \
  --allow-single-repeat
```

This writes a compact experiment-level summary under:

- `reports/experiment-analysis-<slugified-experiment-name>/`

## Building Larger Historic Reproduction Batches

The repo-root files:

- `run_specs.yaml`
- `run_details.yaml`

are the curated historic candidate list produced from:

- `dev/poc/inspect_historic_helm_runs.py`

You can regenerate them with:

```bash
python dev/poc/inspect_historic_helm_runs.py \
  /data/crfm-helm-public \
  --out_fpath run_specs.yaml \
  --out_detail_fpath run_details.yaml
```

To build a larger refreshed kwdagger manifest from those historic candidates:

```bash
bash scripts/make_historic_grid_manifest.sh \
  configs/generated/historic_grid.generated.yaml \
  --experiment-name audit-historic-grid \
  --suite audit-historic-grid \
  --devices 0,1 \
  --tmux-workers 2 \
  --max-eval-instances 1000
```

This also writes a sidecar selection file:

- `.../historic_grid.generated.yaml.selection.yaml`

The selection sidecar records:

- exactly which `run_entry` values were selected
- machine/shard settings
- any model override file that was applied
- matching metadata from `run_details.yaml` when available

### Filtering The Historic Grid

The larger builder supports shell-style pattern filtering and model/benchmark
selection. For example, a Vicuna-only slice over three benchmarks:

```bash
bash scripts/make_historic_grid_manifest.sh \
  configs/generated/historic_vicuna_focus.generated.yaml \
  --experiment-name audit-historic-vicuna-focus \
  --suite audit-historic-vicuna-focus \
  --model lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3 \
  --include-pattern 'boolq:*' \
  --include-pattern 'mmlu:*' \
  --include-pattern 'narrative_qa:*' \
  --devices 0 \
  --tmux-workers 1 \
  --max-eval-instances 1000
```

If any selected entries use `lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3`, the builder automatically
applies:

- `configs/debug/vicuna_no_chat_template.yaml`

so the fixed no-chat-template configuration is used.

### Deterministic One-GPU Shards For Multiple Machines

To split the same filtered candidate set deterministically across multiple
machines, use the shard builder. This is useful for `namek` and `yardrat`,
where only one GPU is available.

Example: build 2 shards from the same filtered historic set.

For `namek`:

```bash
bash scripts/make_machine_shard_manifest.sh \
  namek \
  0 \
  2 \
  configs/generated/namek.generated.yaml \
  --model lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3 \
  --include-pattern 'boolq:*' \
  --include-pattern 'mmlu:*' \
  --include-pattern 'narrative_qa:*' \
  --max-eval-instances 1000
```

For `yardrat`:

```bash
bash scripts/make_machine_shard_manifest.sh \
  yardrat \
  1 \
  2 \
  configs/generated/yardrat.generated.yaml \
  --model lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3 \
  --include-pattern 'boolq:*' \
  --include-pattern 'mmlu:*' \
  --include-pattern 'narrative_qa:*' \
  --max-eval-instances 1000
```

These manifests default to:

- `devices: 0`
- `tmux_workers: 1`

so they are safe for single-GPU machines unless explicitly overridden.

### Same Subset On Multiple Machines For Hardware Comparison

If the goal is to compare reproducibility across different hardware, both
machines should run the same subset rather than different shards.

For `namek`:

```bash
bash scripts/make_machine_subset_manifest.sh \
  namek \
  configs/generated/namek.subset.generated.yaml \
  --model lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3 \
  --include-pattern 'boolq:*' \
  --include-pattern 'mmlu:*us_foreign_policy*' \
  --include-pattern 'narrative_qa:*' \
  --max-eval-instances 1000
```

For `yardrat`, use the same filters:

```bash
bash scripts/make_machine_subset_manifest.sh \
  yardrat \
  configs/generated/yardrat.subset.generated.yaml \
  --model lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3 \
  --include-pattern 'boolq:*' \
  --include-pattern 'mmlu:*us_foreign_policy*' \
  --include-pattern 'narrative_qa:*' \
  --max-eval-instances 1000
```

These produce two manifests with the same selected `run_entry` set but distinct
`experiment_name` / `suite` values, which makes later indexing and
cross-machine analysis easier.

### Running The Larger Batch

Once a manifest has been generated, launch it the same way as the smaller
batches:

```bash
bash scripts/run_from_manifest.sh \
  configs/generated/historic_grid.generated.yaml
```

After raw results are synced back, rebuild the index and analyze the specific
experiment:

```bash
AUDIT_FALLBACK_HOST=aiq-gpu \
bash scripts/index_results.sh

bash scripts/analyze_experiment_from_index.sh \
  --experiment-name audit-historic-grid \
  --allow-single-repeat
```

Note:

- this experiment analyzer uses the kwdagger results index
- it is intended for indexed kwdagger experiments
- direct one-off debug runs that were not scheduled as kwdagger jobs will not appear there

## Reproducibility Checklist

For any experiment you want to cite later, preserve all of the following:

- the exact manifest YAML used to launch the run
- the exact results root under:
  - `/data/crfm-helm-audit/<experiment_name>/`
- the generated comparison reports under:
  - `reports/<experiment_name>/`
- the current git commit of `aiq-magnet`
- the Python executable used as `AIQ_PYTHON`
- the value of:
  - `AIQ_MAGNET_ROOT`
  - `HELM_PRECOMPUTED_ROOT`
  - `AUDIT_RESULTS_ROOT`

Recommended capture commands:

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
which "$AIQ_PYTHON"
scripts/check_env.sh
```

If you need to transfer the run to another machine for analysis, transfer:

- the manifest YAML
- the report directory for the experiment
- the raw results directory for the experiment

Minimum useful transfer set:

- report directory only, if you only need summaries
- report directory plus 1-2 representative raw job directories, if you need direct run artifact inspection
- full raw experiment directory, if you may need to rerun local comparisons later

For newer runs, also preserve:

- `process_context.json` in each kwdagger HELM job directory

That file records structured host/process provenance and is intended to support
future cross-machine and cross-hardware analysis.

## Manifest Schema

The workflow uses a small YAML manifest as the unit of experiment definition.

Fields:

- `schema_version`
- `experiment_name`
- `description`
- `run_entries`
- `max_eval_instances`
- `suite`
- `mode`
- `materialize`
- `backend`
- `devices`
- `tmux_workers`
- `local_path`
- `precomputed_root`
- `require_per_instance_stats`
- `model_deployments_fpath`
- `enable_huggingface_models`
- `enable_local_huggingface_models`

See:

- `configs/smoke_manifest.yaml`
- `configs/apples_manifest.yaml`
- `configs/manifest_template.yaml`

## Smoke-Test Batch

The checked-in smoke batch is intentionally small and uses only models that
already have built-in Hugging Face deployments in HELM:

- `eleutherai/pythia-6.9b`
- `lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3`

Tasks:

- `mmlu:subject=us_foreign_policy,...`
- `boolq:...`
- `narrative_qa:...`

Total:

- 6 runs

Defaults:

- `max_eval_instances=100`
- low worker count
- no custom deployment override YAML

## Apples-To-Apples Smoke Batch

The first apples-to-apples control batch reuses the same 6 smoke entries, but
aligns `max_eval_instances` with the historic public bundle for those entries:

- `max_eval_instances=1000`
- experiment name: `audit-smoke-apples`
- suite: `audit-smoke-apples`
- devices are still controlled by the manifest `devices` field or `--devices`

This is the preferred first batch when the goal is reproduction fidelity rather
than just workflow validation.

Suggested operator flow:

```bash
scripts/make_apples_manifest.sh \
  configs/generated/apples_manifest.generated.yaml \
  --devices 0,1

scripts/run_from_manifest.sh \
  configs/generated/apples_manifest.generated.yaml

scripts/compare_batch.sh \
  configs/generated/apples_manifest.generated.yaml
```

Raw reproduced outputs are written to:

```text
/data/crfm-helm-audit/audit-smoke-apples/
```

Comparison reports are written to:

```text
reports/audit-smoke-apples/
```

Files to inspect first:

- `management_summary_<timestamp>.txt`
- `compare_summary_<timestamp>.txt`
- `compare_cases_<timestamp>.jsonl`

Files to transfer back for local analysis:

- the entire report directory
- optionally the entire raw results directory if deeper run-by-run inspection is needed

Example transfer commands depend on your setup, but a simple pattern is:

```bash
ls -td reports/audit-smoke-apples/*
ls -td /data/crfm-helm-audit/audit-smoke-apples/*
```

Then transfer the newest report files and, if needed, the raw experiment root.

## Exact Reproduction Cases Used In This Research

The following cases were used as the first reproducibility controls in this
research thread.

### Apples-To-Apples Control Batch

Purpose:

- compare current local kwdagger reproductions against official public HELM with matched `max_eval_instances`

Manifest generation:

```bash
scripts/make_apples_manifest.sh \
  configs/generated/apples_manifest.generated.yaml \
  --devices 0,1
```

Run:

```bash
scripts/run_from_manifest.sh \
  configs/generated/apples_manifest.generated.yaml
```

Compare:

```bash
scripts/compare_batch.sh \
  configs/generated/apples_manifest.generated.yaml
```

Outputs:

- raw results:
  - `/data/crfm-helm-audit/audit-smoke-apples/`
- reports:
  - `reports/audit-smoke-apples/`

### Pairwise Repeatability Control: BoolQ / Pythia

Purpose:

- measure ordinary local rerun drift on the same benchmark/model pair

Manifest files used:

- `configs/generated/boolq_pythia_r1.yaml`
- `configs/generated/boolq_pythia_r2.yaml`

Run:

```bash
scripts/run_from_manifest.sh \
  configs/generated/boolq_pythia_r1.yaml

scripts/run_from_manifest.sh \
  configs/generated/boolq_pythia_r2.yaml
```

Direct pairwise compare of the two completed runs:

```bash
scripts/compare_pair.sh \
  /data/crfm-helm-audit/audit-boolq-pythia-r1/helm/helm_id_13jkx9mm4k4n/benchmark_output/runs/audit-boolq-pythia-r1/boolq:model=eleutherai_pythia-6.9b,data_augmentation=canonical \
  /data/crfm-helm-audit/audit-boolq-pythia-r2/helm/helm_id_12jr5w48kge7/benchmark_output/runs/audit-boolq-pythia-r2/boolq:model=eleutherai_pythia-6.9b,data_augmentation=canonical \
  reports/pairwise/boolq-pythia-repeat
```

### Pairwise Official-vs-Local Control: BoolQ / Pythia

Purpose:

- compare one local reproduced run directly against the matched public HELM run

Direct compare:

```bash
scripts/compare_pair.sh \
  /data/crfm-helm-public/classic/benchmark_output/runs/v0.3.0/boolq:model=eleutherai_pythia-6.9b,data_augmentation=canonical \
  /data/crfm-helm-audit/audit-boolq-pythia-r1/helm/helm_id_13jkx9mm4k4n/benchmark_output/runs/audit-boolq-pythia-r1/boolq:model=eleutherai_pythia-6.9b,data_augmentation=canonical \
  reports/pairwise/boolq-pythia-historic
```

### Viewing The Key Reports

```bash
cat reports/pairwise/boolq-pythia-repeat-wide/pair_report_20260327T011202Z.txt
cat reports/pairwise/boolq-pythia-historic-wide/pair_report_20260327T011202Z.txt
```

These two reports are the current best compact illustration of:

- local repeatability drift being small
- official-vs-local drift being much larger
- global tolerance sweeps needing careful interpretation because metric scales differ across classes

## Scaling Up

For larger experiments:

1. copy `configs/manifest_template.yaml`,
2. expand `run_entries`,
3. optionally introduce `model_deployments_fpath` for Together-only families,
4. run:

```bash
scripts/run_from_manifest.sh /path/to/manifest.yaml
scripts/compare_batch.sh /path/to/manifest.yaml
```

## Pairwise Run Reports

To compare any two concrete HELM run directories directly, use:

```bash
scripts/compare_pair.sh \
  /path/to/run_a \
  /path/to/run_b \
  reports/pairwise
```

This writes:

- `pair_report_<timestamp>.json`
- `pair_report_<timestamp>.txt`

The pairwise report includes:

- strict diff diagnosis
- raw run-level distance distributions
- raw instance-level distance distributions
- tolerance sweeps across several preset thresholds

Example using the local repeated `boolq + gpt2` runs:

```bash
scripts/compare_pair.sh \
  /data/crfm-helm-audit/audit-boolq-gpt2-r1/helm/helm_id_lh2zobnkhuwi/benchmark_output/runs/audit-boolq-gpt2-r1/boolq:model=openai_gpt2,data_augmentation=canonical \
  /data/crfm-helm-audit/audit-boolq-gpt2-r2/helm/helm_id_lvb1vuf32m2g/benchmark_output/runs/audit-boolq-gpt2-r2/boolq:model=openai_gpt2,data_augmentation=canonical \
  reports/pairwise
```

Then inspect:

```bash
ls -td reports/pairwise/*
cat reports/pairwise/pair_report_<timestamp>.txt
```

## Indexing Existing Audit Results

The indexer scans all current audit outputs and builds a machine-readable
inventory of what exists.

Use:

```bash
AUDIT_FALLBACK_HOST=aiq-gpu \
scripts/index_results.sh
```

The index currently records:

- experiment name
- job id
- status
- run entry
- benchmark / model / method
- max eval instances
- resolved run directory
- machine host
- GPU fields when recorded
- provenance source (`recorded` vs `fallback`)

This index is the preferred starting point for rebuilding reports against the
latest available runs without manually searching the raw results tree.

## Notes

- This workflow is intended for execution on an external GPU machine.
- The current development environment does not need a GPU to generate manifests
  or comparison commands.
- Comparison relies on `HelmRunDiff` and will emit JSONL, JSON, text, and
  optional sankey artifacts when the required plotting dependencies are
  available.
